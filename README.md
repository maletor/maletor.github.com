## About

This repository hosts the HTML, CSS, images, and posts for [ellisberner.com](http://ellisberner.com). Ellis Berner publishes weekly tips for those who want to learn more about web technology, Ruby on Rails, or linux in general. The blog started as a personal portfolio but grew to include some of my writings. If you find issues with the content, just send [me a message on GitHub](http://github.com/maletor).

## Publishing

This blog is generated with the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine. Simple and easy formatting that sticks to the basics. All static HTML too, so worrying about scalability is non-existent. And GitHub is nice enough to host it for free.

## Contributing

If you have ideas about new posts, layouts, or what have you, fork away!
