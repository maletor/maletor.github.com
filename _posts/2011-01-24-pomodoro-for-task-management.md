# Pomodoro for Task Management

Have a hard time staying focused? The Pomodoro Technique by Francesco Cirillo is an option that might help you become more productive. This technique works well for those who feel anxiety when thinking about deadlines.

The technique shifts time away from stressful work by breaking up the job into manageable pieces. The Pomodoro web site offers a free download of the book that explains all of this in detail. We can accomplish this with minimal tools and just five steps to help the mind focus better and get things done.

1. Pick a task
2. Set the timer to 25 minutes
3. Do the task
4. Take a 5 minute break

Every 4 completed pomodoros take a longer break. Usually around 15 minutes. You will not actually need to buy a timer -- you can use a web application. You can even set your own permalink so that you have a log of everything you have done.

After trying this for one session, it proved greatly helpful. The website says that after 7 to 20 days of continuous use, you will have mastered the art and can more easily apply this style of focus to other areas of life. If you would like more information, visit their website.
