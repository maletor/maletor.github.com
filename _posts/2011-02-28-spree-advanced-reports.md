## Spree Advanced Reports

I developed an advanced reports extension for [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree). It allows admins to view information about users who have bought a line item and similarly, on the product show page, all users who bought a particular item. You can find it on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/maletor).
