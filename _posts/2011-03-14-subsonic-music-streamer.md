## Subsonic Music Streamer

[Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/) is an online music streamer designed for people to have omnipresent music collections. It is written in Java and has been around sinice. The idea of streaming music to your iPod, laptop, or friend's computer is fantastic for sharing music and listening to your collection, be it large or small, wherever you are. The iPhone had an app called Simplify media that was similar to Subsonic but has since stopped development and it looks like they have been bought. The best feature for me is the transcoding of music. I have a lot of music in FLAC and the ability to transcode to V0 MP3 on the fly is important if I want to listen to my music instantly on 3G without buffering for a few minutes.
